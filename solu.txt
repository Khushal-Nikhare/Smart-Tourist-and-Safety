🌍 Solution : Disaster Prediction Methods
1. Using Weather Data (Simple ML Model)
What it means: We take rainfall, temperature, wind speed, humidity etc. from weather stations or APIs.
Why: Heavy rainfall + steep slopes = landslide risk. Sudden rise in rainfall = flood risk.
How:
Collect weather data every hour/day.
Store it in a table (like Excel sheet).
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or LSTM) to say: “If rain > X and slope is Y → landslide likely.”
Tools: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow).
Easy analogy: Like teaching your brain “If clouds are black + strong wind → it may rain soon.”

2. Using Satellite Images (Remote Sensing)
What it means: Satellites (like Sentinel or Landsat) take pictures of Earth daily.
Why: They show rivers swelling (flood risk), soil getting weak (landslide), or cyclone clouds forming.
How:
Download satellite images (free via Google Earth Engine).
Convert images into numbers (e.g., water area, vegetation cover).
Train ML model with those numbers to predict floods/landslides.
Tools: Google Earth Engine + Python.
Easy analogy: Like checking CCTV footage of your house every day to see if water is rising.

3. Crowdsourcing from Phones (Sensors)
What it means: Use tourists’ phones as sensors (accelerometer, GPS).
Why: If many phones shake at the same time → earthquake.
How:
App collects small signals (phone shakes).
Sends to server.
Server checks if many users near one place had shaking → send alert.
Tools: Your app + FastAPI backend.
Easy analogy: Like many people shouting “I felt shaking!” at once → you confirm it’s real.

5. Hybrid Approach (Best in real life)
Combine all:
Weather data + Satellite data + Mobile sensors.
Why: If all signals say “danger” → send strong alert. If only one says → keep as “warning.”
Example:
Rainfall rising fast (weather).
River looks wide in satellite photo.
Physics model says flood possible.
→ All match = send alert immediately.

🛠 Technologies for a Beginner
Programming: Python (simple and powerful for ML).
Data: Weather APIs (like OpenWeather), free satellite data (Google Earth Engine).
ML Libraries:
pandas (handle data tables),
scikit-learn (basic ML),
tensorflow or pytorch (deep learning).
Backend: FastAPI (to connect model with your app).
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS (to store maps + alerts).

📱 How it connects to your App
Model runs on server (Python + FastAPI).
It checks weather/satellite data every few minutes.
If “danger” → server sends alert to app (via Firebase push notification or SMS).
App shows alert + safe routes on map.

🌦 Section 1: Weather-based Features
✅   Parameters (Inputs for Model)
Rainfall (mm/hour or mm/day)
Heavy rainfall is the most direct signal for floods and landslides.
Example: If >100 mm in 24 hours → flood risk.
Temperature (°C)
Sudden rise → heatwave, drought risk.
Drop + high humidity → heavy rainfall chance.
Humidity (%)
High humidity + high temperature = thunderstorms or cyclones.
Wind Speed (km/h)
Strong winds indicate storms or cyclones.
Example: >60 km/h = storm warning.
Wind Direction (degrees)
Shows where cyclone or storm is moving.
Air Pressure (hPa)
Falling air pressure = storm/cyclone approaching.
Example: Drop below 1000 hPa = cyclone warning.

🎯 Easy Analogy
Like a person looking outside:
If clouds are dark + strong wind + air pressure low → you guess a storm is coming.
That’s exactly what the model learns!

🛰 Section 2: Satellite Image Features (Remote Sensing)
✅   Parameters (Inputs for Model from Satellite Images)

        .filterDate('2025-09-01', '2025-09-02') \
        .mean()


# Calculate NDVI
ndvi = img.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4'])
Python Libraries
geemap → for GEE maps.
rasterio → read satellite rasters.
pandas → store extracted values.

🎯 Easy Analogy
Imagine satellite images as CCTV cameras for Earth:
If water spreads outside the river boundary → CCTV shows flood.
If hill looks brown (no green plants) → slope weak, landslide risk.
If white spiral clouds appear → cyclone alert.
📱 Section 3: Crowdsourcing from Phones (Sensors)
✅   Parameters (Inputs from Mobile Devices)
Accelerometer Data
Detects shaking/vibration.
If many phones in one area shake → possible earthquake.
GPS Location (Lat, Long)
Needed to map where shaking or flood is happening.
Helps identify the disaster zone.
Gyroscope Data
Detects tilt/movement of phone.
Can confirm unusual ground vibration.
Barometer / Pressure Sensor
Some phones have it.

🔹 Solutions for "No Network" Areas to give ALERT
✅   1. Cell Broadcast (like Government Emergency Alerts)
This is the same system that shows “Earthquake Alert” or “Flood Warning” pop-ups on your phone without internet.
The alerts are sent directly from telecom towers → no mobile data required.
Industry-level apps cannot do this on their own (requires government + telecom permissions).
If you partner with local government/telecom, your disaster alerts can also be broadcast through this system.

✅   2. Satellite-based Alerts (for Tourists)
If the tourist’s mobile is connected with a satellite SMS receiver app or wearable device (e.g., Garmin inReach, SPOT device), they can receive alerts without mobile towers.
Already used in trekking/adventure apps like AllTrails, Garmin Explore.
Your app can integrate with satellite alert APIs (Garmin, Iridium).
Step 1: What are Garmin / Iridium Devices?
Small, pocket-sized satellite communicators.
Example: Garmin inReach Mini 2.
Features:
2-way messaging via satellite.
SOS button → immediately alerts the nearest rescue center with GPS location.
Works without mobile network.

✅   3. Offline Mesh Networking (App-to-App Communication)
If some phones have network and others don’t → messages can be spread phone-to-phone using Bluetooth / WiFi Direct / LoRa Mesh.
Example: Bridgefy App (used in Hong Kong protests) → worked without internet by spreading alerts device-to-device.
In React Native, you can use:
react-native-wifi-p2p
react-native-ble-plx (Bluetooth Low Energy)
Use case: One tourist gets network → alert received → shared locally with nearby tourists via Bluetooth/WiFi.

✅   4. Offline Pre-downloaded Safety Data
When the user installs the app (or whenever they get internet), the app downloads hazard maps + safe shelters for offline use.
If real-time alerts can’t be received due to no network, the app can still:
Show: “⚠️ No Network – Stay on marked safe trails only.”
Use phone’s sensors (accelerometer + GPS + barometer) to detect sudden earthquakes or landslides.
Example: Google’s Android Earthquake Alerts works even without internet → it uses phone sensors + crowd-sourced detection.

✅   5. Community/Rescue Volunteers with Radio
Disaster-prone hill stations already have wireless radio networks (HAM, police, forest departments).
Your backend can notify these volunteers → they spread alerts via loudspeakers or radios.

✅   6. Satellite SOS in Modern Smartphones
New smartphones (iPhone 14+, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra) have built-in Satellite SOS features.
Even without mobile signal → tourists can send emergency SMS via satellite.
Example: iPhone 14 “Emergency SOS via Satellite” → user points phone towards the sky → message goes directly via satellite.

📱 Tourist Side (In-App Features)
Your app can add an “Offline SOS Mode”:
If no network → the app guides the tourist:
“Use your Garmin/iPhone Satellite SOS to send alert.”
App can connect to Garmin devices via Bluetooth using:
react-native-bluetooth-serial

⚠️ Challenges
Expensive (per SMS/MB charges).
Requires partnerships with satellite providers (Garmin, Iridium, Starlink).
Not every tourist will have a satellite-enabled phone/device.
But with government collaborations (NDMA, State Tourism Dept) → feasible at large scale.

🔮 Future (2025 & Beyond)
Starlink + Direct-to-Phone: Elon Musk’s Starlink is working on connecting normal 4G phones directly to satellites.
In future, even normal tourists will receive satellite SMS/alerts without special devices.
In India, BSNL + OneWeb project is also working to provide satellite connectivity in hill stations.

✅ Summary:
Short Term → Push notifications, SMS, mesh networking, offline maps.
Long Term → Direct-to-phone satellite alerts (Starlink, OneWeb, iPhone SOS).

🌍 Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System
P1: Core App (Frontend with React Native)
📱 The mobile app tourists will actually use.
Why React Native?
You already know JavaScript → easier for you.
Single code → works on Android & iOS.
Big ecosystem + support.
Key Libraries:
react-native-paper → ready-made UI components (buttons, forms, cards).
react-navigation → move between pages (Home, Alerts, Profile, Map).
react-native-maps → embed Google Maps in the app.
expo-location → get user’s live GPS location.
react-native-background-geolocation → keep tracking location even when app is closed.
Features in this phase:
Register/Login (later connected with blockchain).
Map screen (shows tourist’s current location).
Alerts tab (list of warnings & safe shelters).
Profile tab (user’s info stored on blockchain).

P2: Backend (FastAPI – Python)
⚙️ This is the “brain” that connects app + AI model + database.
Why FastAPI?
Very fast, beginner-friendly, modern Python framework.
Easy to connect AI models (since Python is best for ML).
Key Libraries:
fastapi + uvicorn → run backend server.
sqlalchemy → talk to relational databases (like PostgreSQL).
pydantic → check data (example: no wrong format for GPS coordinates).
websockets → real-time communication (instant alerts).
firebase-admin → send push notifications.
Features in this phase:
Receive data from app (location, user info).
Connect with database to store users + disaster logs.
Call AI model API to check if disaster is predicted.
Send alerts to app when risk detected.

P3: Database (Storage System)
💾 We need a reliable place to store all info.
Options:
PostgreSQL (best for structured data)
Example tables: Users, Alerts, Predictions, Safe Routes.
MongoDB (best for unstructured data/logs)
Example collections: Sensor logs, AI input history.
Key Libraries:
sqlalchemy + psycopg2 → for PostgreSQL.
pymongo → for MongoDB.
Data Stored:
Users (linked with blockchain ID).
Location logs of tourists.
Prediction model results.
Alert messages (who received what).

P4: Blockchain-based Digital ID
🔐 Tourist identity must be secure + tamper-proof.
Why Blockchain?
Digital ID is immutable (cannot be faked).
Government/Hotels/Rescue teams can trust it.
Tech Stack:
Polygon / Ethereum Blockchain (Polygon is cheaper).
Smart Contracts → code deployed on blockchain for ID storage.
Wallets: MetaMask / Web3 wallets.
Libraries:
web3.js (React Native side) → connect app with blockchain.
ethers.js → handle wallet & transactions.
solidity → to write smart contracts for ID.
Features:
Each tourist gets a Digital Safety ID when registering.
ID contains: Name, National ID, Emergency Contact.
Stored on blockchain → secure, not editable by anyone.

P5: AI Disaster Prediction Model
🤖 Predicting disasters early.
Step 1 – Collect Data:
Weather (rainfall, temperature, wind) → via APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
River/Water level → government sensors, satellites.
Seismic activity → earthquake monitoring APIs.
Historical data of past disasters.
Step 2 – Preprocess Data:
pandas → handle datasets.
numpy → calculations.
scikit-learn → normalize/clean data.
Step 3 – Train Model:
Machine Learning:
Random Forest, Decision Trees (simple models).
Library: scikit-learn.
Deep Learning (for accuracy):
LSTM (time-series like rainfall patterns).
CNN (satellite image analysis).
Libraries: tensorflow or pytorch.
Step 4 – Deploy Model:
Save model (joblib or .h5).
Load into FastAPI → expose endpoint like /predict-disaster.

P6: Geo-Fencing & Location Safety
🗺️ Prevent tourists from entering unsafe zones.
Geo-fencing: A virtual “circle” around a dangerous area. If tourist enters → instant alert.
Libraries:
geopy (Python) → calculate distance between points.
react-native-background-geolocation → monitor user’s movement.
How it works:
AI predicts “danger zone” → backend creates geo-fence.
App checks: “Is user inside this circle?”
If yes → app vibrates + shows red warning on map.

P7: Disaster Alert & Communication
📢 How to alert users when disaster occurs.
Case 1: Network Available
WebSocket (FastAPI) → instant real-time alerts.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) → push notifications.
Case 2: No Network (Hill Station Issue)
Satellite SMS APIs (Iridium, Starlink, Garmin).
Bluetooth Mesh Networking → nearby phones share alert (using react-native-ble-plx).
Offline Maps + Pre-downloaded Safety Data → still guide users if no internet.

P8: Safe Route Finder
🛣️ Suggest safest path to escape disaster.
Tech:
Google Maps Directions API → get multiple routes.
AI + Algorithms:
Filter out routes crossing danger zones.
Use Dijkstra’s Algorithm or A* → find shortest safe path.
